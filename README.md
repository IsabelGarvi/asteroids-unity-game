Small demo level of the famous Asteroids game.  
The player can move through the screen using the *W* key, the ship will go to where the mouse is on the scene.

There are 3 different asteroids:
- Big: takes 35 points of life if it hits the ship.
- Medium: takes 20 points of life if it hits the ship.
- Small: takes 5 points of life if it hits the ship.

We start the game with a random number of big asteroids, in a range from 3 to 7.
When a **big** asteroid is detroyed by the fire, 2 **medium** ones appear in its place.  
When a **medium** asteriod is When a BIG asteroid is detroyed by the fire, 2 **small** ones appear in its place.  
When ***ALL*** asteroids have been destroyed, the level is clear and more BIG asteroids appear.
